    "In this project, we present an enhanced car recommendation system that combines web scraping, user interaction, and real-time data to provide personalized car recommendations. Initially, we used BeautifulSoup to scrape car data from Kelly Blue Book, obtaining a comprehensive dataset that includes details such as seating capacity, fuel type, model, year, and make.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system prompts users to input their preferences for their \"dream car,\" allowing for customized filtering of the dataset. By integrating the previously demonstrated web scraping code for actual car listings, users are presented with real-time options to purchase their dream car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we have prioritized user interaction, continuously refining our recommendation system based on feedback. The backend code handles data processing, cleaning, and filtering, ensuring a seamless and personalized experience for users.\n",
